## üèóÔ∏è Building for Web (GitHub Pages Example)

To create a web build suitable for deployment (e.g., to GitHub Pages):

1.  **Run the build command:**
    *   This command uses the HTML renderer (often better for SEO and initial load performance than CanvasKit) and sets the base URL path, crucial for deploying to a subdirectory like `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
    ```bash
    flutter build web --web-renderer html --base-href /black_ants_app/
    ```
2.  **Deploy:**
    *   Commit the contents of the `build/web` directory to your deployment branch (e.g., `gh-pages`).
    *   Configure your hosting service (like GitHub Pages) to serve files from that branch/directory.
